# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview of the project

We're helping to build the PlanMyTrip app and in this assignnment we are going to complete the following taks:

1. Retieve Weather Data

We generate 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes, then we could retrieve data from aprox 749 cities applying some of the next tools, functions and methods:
* Using dpendencies; numpy, citypy, requests, time
* Starting URL for Weather Map API Call.
* Parse the JSON and retrieve data
* Convert the array of dictionaries to a Pandas DataFrame.
* Create the output file (CSV).
* Export into a CSV.

2. Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map

Use input statements to retrieve customer weather preferences, then use those preferences to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. Then, show those destinations on a marker layer map with pop-up markers. Applying some of the following tools, functions and methods:
* Using dpendencies; numpy, requests, gmaps, gmaps.dtatsets
* import a cvs file
* Prompt the user to enter minimum and maximum temperature
* Set up the base URL for the Google Directions API to get JSON data
* Set parameters to search for hotels: _params_
* Make request and retrieve the JSON data from the search. 
* Export into a CSV.
* marker layer map with a pop-up marker

3. Create a Travel Itinerary Map

Use the Google Directions API to create a travel itinerary that shows the route between four cities chosen from the customerâ€™s possible travel destinations. Then, create a marker layer map with a pop-up marker for each city on the itinerary.

* Use the gmaps documentation (Links to an external site.) to create a directions layer map.
